<p>I am currently a Product Manager at IBM Security living and working in New York City. I graduated from Amherst College with a degree in Computer Science and have worked in a few different roles at IBM for the last 4 years. I am very passionate about learning and focused on cybersecurity, cloud computing, and food. All three of these are heavily dependent upon the practices of data science to not only exist, but continue to evolve. My goal in learning data science is to better arm myself with the skills to create, experience to ask the right questions, and the confidence to change the world. Every weeknight at 7:00pm ET, you will most likely find me glued to the television tuned to NBC watching Jeopardy. I try not to miss an episode.</p>
