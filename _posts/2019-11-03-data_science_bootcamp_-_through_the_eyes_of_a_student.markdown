Earlier this year, I was accepted into and began a part-time Data Science bootcamp online program that would stretch from January to November. It was an exciting opportunity to learn new skills in data visualization, machine learning, and predictive modelling that would complement my background as a software engineer, math enthusiast, and cybersecurity professional. 

My goal in pursuing this skillset was to gain a competitive edge over those vying for top positions at the largest tech companies. I also wanted to have something in addition to work that I really cared about. Data science was that perfect combination of something familiar and something completely new and foreign to me. That was the draw and that is what kept me going for 10 months as I progressed through the extensive curriculum.

**Learning from my Instructor and Cohort**

My cohort and instructors were instrumental in my learning and absorption of the lessons in the year's curriculum. The instructor certainly took the lead in guiding our small group through the lessons and core data science, math, and programming concepts. But he allowed for students to participate, run with ideas, and ask clarifying questions. This was essential to my understanding as I prefer learning in tandem with others and enjoy experiencing the different ways that others see a similar problem.

**Diving into the Curriculum**

The year’s lessons and projects were broken up into 5 major learning modules with focuses on high-level concepts of data science. 

* Module 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
* Module 2: Advanced Data Retrieval
* Module 3: Models for Machine Learning
* Module 4: Advanced Machine Learning
* Module 5: Capstone Project

Our first priority was to establish the baseline of coding and mathematical skills required to start building upon the foundations of data science, data analytics, and object-oriented programming. We started to learn how to load, clean, and manipulate data in Pandas and established the primary Python libraries that we would use to accelerate our efforts. 

Working in Jupyter Notebooks, we all practiced using the tools we were given and eventually connected all coding and statistical lessons into a comprehensive project. End of module projects allowed us to demonstrate the skills we were taught along the way and provided an accurate measurement of how quickly our arsenals of data science proficiencies were growing.

The curriculum moved quickly as each week introduced two brand new lessons to consume and quickly apply to code-along exercises and hands-on labs. I really excelled through the first module as much of the background coding aspects of the course were review, but I was humbled by the advanced statistical knowledge required to understand everything that goes on behind the curtains of the Python functions we were using.

My favorite module was certainly the final lesson-based one, Module 4 – Advanced Machine Learning. I will have to admit that it took a lot of restraint and patience to progress through some sections of Modules 1-3 as we were only exposed to snippets of key concepts and

**Participating in Study Groups**

Study groups were led by the instructor, but the small size of the cohort enabled each of the students to become the teacher for portions of class. I found it to be much more valuable an experience to come to each study group having read through the lessons to be covered in advance. When I had the time, I even supplemented the lesson material with outside sources to better understand key concepts like gradient descent or Bayesian classification. It helped me to teach to other students what I had learned and further reinforced the material. It also did not hurt to impress my instructor.

Each of our weekly sessions flew by as we tore through the material and enjoyed long discussions about the approaches demonstrated in the labs and code-alongs. Toward the end of modules, the lessons started to indicate what the projects would challenge us with. This may have been daunting to some, but I could not wait to exhibit what I had learned and add my own creativity to the output.

**Developing Portfolio Projects**

A data scientist’s portfolio is a substantive representation of their skills and ability to ask a question and pursue different approaches on how best to answer it. This data science bootcamp enabled me as a student to build and polish an impressive portfolio of projects that present my ability to implement the OSEMN framework of data science processes.

**O**btaining our data
**S**crubbing our data
**E**xploring our data
**M**odeling our data
i**N**terpreting our results

Projects varied from working with the King County House Sales Dataset to predict housing prices in the Seattle, Washington area to our capstone project which allowed each student to choose and create our own data sets, questions, and modeling approaches. I can think back to working on each project and immediately remember a key lesson or best practice that I learned. Whether it was the importance of cleaning data (seeing firsthand the concept of garbage in, garbage out) or model evaluation when testing the accuracy of a neural network, there was value derived from each experience.
 
**Career Coaching and Interviewing**

One of the most important aspects of this course was the career coaching and resources that the educational program afforded its students to prepare us for the professional world. Not only were we learning the skills needed to become practicing data scientists, we were also guided through all components of the interviewing process. It is often the initial barrier to entry that prevents most from succeeding, but it was very beneficial to have an established educational program with direct connections to major companies seeking to hire entry-level data scientists. That pipeline increased the chances of landing not only a job in the field of my choosing, but the right job at the right company.

**Employment**

My next chapter awaits me in the new year as I start working at a new company and a new technical role. My data science certification and the skills I demonstrated in the interview process propelled me ahead of the candidates and rewarded
