Why did I decide to learn data science? Great question and we will get there. But first, I want to highlight a different question. A question that people frequently ask my father, "How did you get your son to follow you into a career in IT security?"

To give you some background, my dad has had a long and illustrious career in IT and is a global leader in cybersecurity for the finance and healthcare industries. He is an analytical thinker, a self-identified technology "nerd", and a devoted teacher to share his experiences with others. Early in his career, he realized that programmers were the designers of the future. That future was software. 

So, early in my childhood, my dad made the decision that I was going to be a software engineer.

As he tells it...my dad first introduced me to a computer in 2002 when I was just 9 years old in 3rd grade attending Hillside Elementary School in Allendale, NJ. 

As a great father and teacher, he wanted to share with me his knowledge of the inner workings of a computer, the process of software development, and the basic concepts of networking with the expectation that I would immediately love it and follow in his footsteps into a productive career in IT. However, about 10 minutes into my first lesson on how to open a Windows command shell, it was clear that I had no interest and I was already halfway out the door to go play outside. Perhaps I was just too young or maybe the direct approach was not the best one.

Over the years, my dad would make further attempts to peak my interest on the topic. He shared stories about his job and recent cyberattacks on major businesses and governments, would buy the latest tech gadgets and computers, and event claims to have bribed me into another lesson. For some reason, I still wanted no part in learning how computers worked, how software was developed, and was ok going through life not knowing.

Fast forward 9 years later and you would find me in my first semester of sophomore year at Amherst College. I was on the Pre-Med track with a focus in Biology and Medical Research but was unsure of my future on that path. Another 5-10 years of medical school, student loans, and long hours at a hospital did not excite me. It was at that inflection point that I decided to explore other disciplines and found an introductory computer science course to add to my course load. Perhaps it was the years of my father attempting to teach me the basics of computers that steered me toward that computer science course, or maybe it was fate…

In that time since taking that leap with my first computer science course, I have graduated from Amherst with an undergraduate degree in computer science, I have taken a number of advanced statistics courses, and I have worked for two years as a software engineer at IBM developing enterprise solutions with Watson and other artificial intelligence and machine learning based services and products. With my background in developing secure software, I migrated into cybersecurity immersing myself into the industry through books, articles, personal research projects. Now I am a cybersecurity professional at IBM living and working in New York City. All of those steps along the way have been significant milestones that represent my early phases of growth as a technology professional.  

So we go back to the original question that I have avoided answering directly until now, “Why did I decide to learn data science?”

As an analytical thinker and future data scientist, I can likely attribute that first decision and the thousands of decisions since then that have gotten me to where I am today as a student in the Flatiron School Data Science Program to the persistence and intelligence of my dad.

Now realize that aspects and applications of data science are all around us impacting the decisions we make about what we eat and drink, what we watch on tv, or how we get to work. Data are frequently the driving force behind those decisions and the quality of that data often determines the outcome. I want to make better decisions in all facets of life, feel smarter and better informed, see this convoluted world more clearly, and do something big. I want to do something at the same scale of developing the Internet and share it with the world.

I believe that I made the choice to pursue data science as the next phase in my career just in the last 8 months leading up to this program at Flatiron. But at the same time, I feel as though the first seed to impact that decision was unknowingly planted by a younger version of myself, in the basement of the New Jersey home I grew up in, sitting with my dad, an open Windows terminal, and a computer.
