As an aspiring data scientist wanting to increase my exposure to the lessons that others have learned through experience, I have found that online blogs are one of the best, if not the best, available tools to better understand complicated topics and learn about the latest advancements in the data science field.

I’ve read articles written by some of the most accomplished analytical minds on the cutting edge of advancement in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. But, I’ve also been exposed to blogs written by those just starting out in this space, eager to consume the wealth of knowledge that is out there while also doing their part to contribute. There is tremendous value in both outputs and all variations in between because we all think differently about a problem and develop a diverse array of ideas on how to implement solutions. I see no need to discount an idea simply based on the experience of the person proposing it.

But why are blogs such an advantageous format to represent complex ideas? Here are a few aspects that speak to their importance in the rising data science community.

**Friendly on the outside**

Often when I encounter a new application, tool, or model, it is often an overwhelming barrier that you find yourself coming up against. Complicated concept like semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labelling initially intimidate me and an established research paper conducted by a team of data scientists demonstrating their applications of five different approaches and results if not the ideal place to start at square one.

But surfing the Internet for resources, I often come across blogs with friendly titles like, “Semi-Supervised Learning for Beginners.” All of a sudden, my insecurities disappear, and I am starting to learn about the foundational building blocks of machine learning variations and the advantages and disadvantages of an approach. 

I also enjoy learning more about the authors behind the posts. Many forums include brief profiles on the data scientists behind the text which helps me understand the voice that I am reading in the article. Often the industry that the data scientist operates in is evident in the examples they choose to include and references.

Many blog forums also supplement the article titles, author’s name, and publication date with how long it will take to read. Telling the reader that it only takes seven minutes to read sounds much more achievable than an 18-page research paper.

**Telling a Story to Teach a Lesson**

Blog posts offer data scientists the opportunity to tell a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Authors get to create characters, setting, plot, conflict, and resolution – the key elements of a story. This structure helps the reader to grasp the lessons and is something that we are all familiar with. What a perfect format to teach others about the complex mechanics behind Artificial Neural Networks and Backpropagation! 

**Consumability – for all skill levels and aptitudes**

Blogs are written by and can be consumed by practitioners of all skill levels, years of experience, and analytical proficiency. There is no advantage to isolating a particular group or preventing eager learners from accessing new information.

**Connecting methods directly to applications of a concept – Graphs + Text + Code**

I particularly enjoy blogs that include graphics, data visualization, and code snippets supplementing the raw text to provide actual examples of the core concepts in action. There is a next level of learning that occurs when I not only learn a concept, but I am also able to leverage tested Python code and cater it to my needs in a project. Everyone’s development background is different in the learning modules, education courses, and approaches preferred. It benefits everyone to readily share what works for a particular problem (and sometimes more importantly, what doesn’t).

**Learning through the experiences of others**

What better way to advance your knowledge on a topic than to outsource the work to other people? Only half kidding. But we as individuals are not able to actively test and investigate every approach to a solution. It would take too long and is not a scalable tactic. It is a good thing that there is no need to personally do everything in order to learn from it.

Data science blogging is a method of crowdsourcing that enables us as individuals to consume the necessary knowledge gleaned from others to better inform our own pursuits. I certainly feel that I learn more after an hour of reading blogs than I would from experimenting just with my known toolbox of Python libraries. It is the combination of my skills and knowledge with the experiences of others that garner the best results.
